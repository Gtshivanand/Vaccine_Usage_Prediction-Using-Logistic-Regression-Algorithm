## Introduction:
Vaccination plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases and ensuring public health. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a major challenge, influenced by various demographic, psychological, and socio-economic factors.

This project, "Vaccine Usage Prediction - Using Logistic Regression Algorithm", aims to predict whether an individual is likely to take a vaccine based on different influencing factors such as age, health conditions, income level, and trust in medical institutions.

By leveraging Logistic Regression, a widely used classification algorithm, we can analyze trends, identify key factors affecting vaccine acceptance, and provide valuable insights for policymakers and healthcare professionals. The results of this project can be used to design effective awareness campaigns and improve vaccination rates globally.


## Problem Statement:

The data set is the response of people to the h1n1 flu vaccine related questionnaire. The respondents are people of age 6 months and older. This survey was designed to monitor the influenza immunization coverage in 2009-10 season. Machine learning techniques may aid a more efficient analysis in the prediction of how likely the people are to opt for the flu vaccine. In this case study, we predict, how likely it is that the people will take a H1N1 flu vaccine.        


## Project Overview:
This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict vaccine usage based on key demographic and behavioral features. By utilizing **Logistic Regression**, the model determines the likelihood of individuals opting for vaccination based on historical and survey data.

The dataset used in this project contains survey responses from individuals regarding their decision to take a vaccine. It includes demographic, health-related, and social factors affecting vaccination behavior. The dataset consists of features such as **age, gender, education level, occupation, health conditions, and vaccination history**.
